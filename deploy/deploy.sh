# Educa Staff Portal release. Runs as tito on the Codepasstech VPS, no sudo.
#
# stdin is a gzipped tar of the built dist/, streamed by GitHub Actions:
#     tar -czf - -C dist . | ssh -i <key> tito@<host>
#
# Installed as /home/tito/bin/educa-portal-deploy and pinned as the forced command on
# that repo's CI SSH key. Deliberately a COPY of deploy/deploy.sh, not a
# symlink into a checkout: a forced command must not be rewritable by anyone
# who can push, or the restriction is worth nothing. Re-install by hand when
# this file changes:
#
#     install -m 0755 deploy/deploy.sh /home/tito/bin/educa-portal-deploy
